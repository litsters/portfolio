    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>These are a few of the projects I've worked on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h2>Ticket To Ride</h2>
        <p>This is a full implementation of the board game Ticket To Ride.  It was written for Android and uses a server to allow multiplayer.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>TreeSweeper</h2>
        <p>This is a research project I'm involved in with my job.  It is a program that can download your family history off of FamilySearch then scan it for possible errors.  It's far easier to extend than FamilySearch's current offerings, is far more flexible, and uses real distributions to give more accurate results.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Savage Borderlands</h2>
        <p>This is a project I'm working on in my own time.  It's a webapp that to help players and GM's for a Savage Worlds adaptation of the popular video game Borderlands.  It includes interactive character sheets and random item generation, and will eventually include mission and world information.</p>
